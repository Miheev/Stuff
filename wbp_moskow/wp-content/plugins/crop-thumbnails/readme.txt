The plugin enhance functionality to crop your thumbnails individuell and simple. It add links on backend to enter all images you had attached to a post, page or custom-post.
In the Crop-Editor you can choose one or more (if they have the same ratio) imagesizes and cut-off the part of the image you want.

It is possible to filter the list of available image-sizes (in dependency to post-types) in the settings (Settings > Crop-Thumbnails).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What languages are supported? =
* English
* German (de_DE)
* brazilian portuguese (pt_BR) - thanks to Alex Meusburger
* Ukrainian (uk) - thanks to Jurko Chervony from www.skinik.name

= What internal rules use the plugin for cropping? =
* The plugin will only crop image-sizes where crop is set to "true" (hard crop mode - see: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_image_size).
* If you had set one of image dimension in add_image_size to "0" or "9999" (an set crop to true) the plugin will crop it in the ratio of the original image.
* You are able to crop all images with the same ratio at once (default) or and any imagesize (and ratio) seperate.

= I have cropped the image but the old one is used on the page. =
If you had viewed your image on the site before, your browser has cached the image. Go tell them to reload the fresh image from the server by hitting "F5".

= I have cropped the image but in the featured-image box in the editor the croped version dont show up =
Refresh or Update the editor page.  
Note that the image in the featured-image box will only be a preview, to show what image is choosed. The theme defines what image-size is used on the front-end. 

= Is it possible to crop an non-cropped image-size? =
Currently not.

= Is it possible to adjust the css-style of the crop-thumbnail window? =
Yes, for a simple test, copy the css/cpt-window.css file into your template_directory and make some change.
Then add this code into the functions.php of your template.

`add_filter('crop_post_thumbnail_window_css','myCustomStyle');
function myCustomStyle($content) {
	$content = get_bloginfo('template_directory').'/cpt-window.css';
	return $content;
}`
