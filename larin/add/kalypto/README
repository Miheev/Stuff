*
* Description: Kalypto is a basic plugin to allow you to use a 
* graphic  in place of a checkbox or radio button.  Styles for the 
* checked/non-checked state should be defined in a 
* stylesheet and a sprite added, and the plugin handles building 
* a new element, changes the class and keeps the checkbox or
* radio button updated with the correct state.
*
* Formerly called ReplaceRCInputs.
*
* Kalypto = καλυπτω (Greek) which translates to "to cover, to conceal"
*
* browser support: 
*	 IE8+ (been tested wtih IE7, but not officially supporting IE7 or below)
*	 Chrome (which should include Opera)
*	 Firefox

        // This is the active (or selected/checked) class
        checkedClass: "checked",

        // with a data-label attribute on the input (data-label="Custom Text")
        dataLabel: "",
