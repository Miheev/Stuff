== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[See the official FAQ at FastSecureContactForm.com](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/faq-wordpress-version)

= I just installed this and do not get any email from it, what could be wrong? =

[See FAQ page: How to troubleshoot email delivery](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/email-does-not-send)

= If I upgrade from version 3.xx, will my forms and settings be lost? =
No, it will automatic import of settings from versions 2.5.6 up to 3.xx. As long as you do not use the delete button when deactivating the plugin.
You can and should [make a backup of your forms](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/backup-restore-forms).

= I upgraded from version 3.xx, to 4.xx and my forms and settings did not import =

The forms should have imported. In some rare cases, they don't import. Sorry for any inconvenience. 
Update to the latest version, click the button on the Tools tab "Import forms from 3.xx version". 

More help is on this help page:
[I upgraded to 4.xx version and my forms did not import](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/forms-did-not-import)

= What happens during upgrade from 3.xx, where are the settings stored? =

The upgrade is run automatically only once after installing or upgrading the 4.xx version over a 3.xx versions.
The 4.xx version uses different wp options settings than 3.xx
The options settings are rows in the wp_options database table.

4.xx wp_options:
fs_contact_global,
fs_contact_form1,
fs_contact_form2,
fs_contact_form3,

3.xx wp_options:
si_contact_gb,
si_contact_form,
si_contact_form2,
si_contact_form3,
si_contact_form4,

During 4.xx install, the installation looks to see if 4.xx options are not present(first time install), and if 3.xx options are present(3.xx was installed previously), if it passes both those tests, then it runs the import code in
class-fscf-import.php

= How do I backup or restore my forms? =

On the Tools settings tab is a backup / restore tool.
The backup / restore feature can be used for backups or as a site to site transfer. You can back up ALL forms and transfer ALL forms to the same or new site using the restore feature. Or you can back up individual forms and restore them to the the same or new site replacing any one form selected during the restore. Please consider that restoring one form or ALL forms makes permanent replacements to the forms already on the site you restore them to.

CSS experts will like the flexibility of using their own custom style sheet by enabling "External Style Sheet CSS", then the FSCF CSS will NOT be included inline in the form HTML, and the custom CSS below must be included in the style.css of the theme. Be sure to remember this if you switch your theme later on.
