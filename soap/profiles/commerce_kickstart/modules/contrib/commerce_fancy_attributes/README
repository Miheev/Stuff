This module provides a "Rendered term" attribute mode, that
shows the rendered term instead of a radio button (degrades to a normal
radio button when JS is off).

Example usage:
0) Enable this module.
1) Create a Color vocabulary, add a text field called "Color" that will hold
hex values. Go to "Manage Display", click the tab called "Add to Cart form - Attribute",
enable only the color field (with the label hidden).
2) Create several terms with matching hex colors (Black: #cccccc, White: #ffffff, etc).
3) Add a Color taxonomy_term_reference field to a product type.
4) On the Field UI edit page for the Color field, select "Rendered term" as
the attribute type.

The Add To Cart form will now show the colors.

Extras
------
The same color blocks can also be shown on the product display, representing
each color present on the referenced products.

A good match for this module is Field Extractor (http://drupal.org/project/field_extractor).
Together with this module, it allows you to show the same color representation
on a product display.

0) Install Entityreference 7.x-1.x-dev and Field Extractor 7.x-1.x-dev.
Patch entityreference with the patch from http://drupal.org/node/1580348.
This will give you the "Rendered entity" formatter on the taxonomy term fields.
1) Select the Field Extractor formatter for the product reference field, or
add the Field Extractor views field to a view.
2) In the settings, select the color reference field that you've added to the
product type. Then select "Rendered entity" as the formatter, and
"Add to Cart form - Attribute" as the view mode.
