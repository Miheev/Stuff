    <p>
      Tax rates specify the percentage amount added to each product.
      They can be applied conditionally based on different  <a href="/admin/commerce/config/product-pricing">pricing rules</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each tax rate is of a specific type. Tax types can be display inclusive (VAT), meaning that they are shown as a part of the
      price that the customer sees on the product pages, or they can be display exclusive (Sales tax), which means that the customer
      doesn't see it before visiting the shopping cart.
