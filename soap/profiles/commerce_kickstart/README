Commerce Kickstart is an installation profile designed to get up and running
quickly with Drupal Commerce. It duplicates a standard Drupal installation and
provides additional configuration for Commerce modules and components. While we
intend for this installation profile to be the entrance point for many new users
to Drupal Commerce, we will also be maintaining drush make files and eventual
Features integration to make it a starting point for advanced Drupal users to
quickly build out new e-commerce sites.
