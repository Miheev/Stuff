You can install the theme through the WordPress installer under "Themes" > "Install themes" by searching for it.

of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the theme.

========= Instructions =========

Theme Sugar & Spice offers custom Theme Options, which can be found under Appereance->Theme Options.
Theme customization options:
* Color scheme & Accent color. Color scheme setting controls the color of links and buttons. Accent color chnages ribbon color and widget title.
* Logo upload. You can upload your own image to serve as website logo. If no image is uploaded website title and description will be used instead. Max logo width: 1000px;
* Favicon. You can upload your own custom favicon, whichis the small 16px by 16px picture you see beside URL in browser's address bar. Image should be named favicon.ico
* Custom Background - you can set your own custom background using WordPress built in background option (Apperance->Background).
* Layout options. You can choose from one of three ways of displaying blog posts (Layout options). These are applied to home page only. Categories & Archives are always displayed as excerpts.
* Post meta display options. These refer to post information (date, author, comments) displayed below each post title on home page & categories/archives pages.
* Post signature image. You have the option to insert image directly after post content. This can be your signature or anything else. Applied to all posts. Accepts only images!

Sugar & Spice comes with custom gallery, which replaces standard WordPress image gallery with image slideshow. You can still use tiled or other types of galleries that come with Jetpack plugin.

If you wish to further customize the theme I recommend using My Custom CSS plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/my-custom-css/ for CSS only ), or creating a child theme.

If Sugar & Spice theme is being activated on already existing website, it's highly recommended to regenerate post thumbnails
using the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).
