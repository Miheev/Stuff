Disables the theme, plugin and core update checking, the related cronjobs and notification system.

== Description ==

This plugin completely disables the theme, plugin and core update checking system in WordPress. The plugin prevents WordPress from 
checking for updates including cronjobs, and prevents any notifications from being displayed.

This plugin combines und extends these three plugins:

* [Disable WordPress Theme Update](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-theme-updates/)
* [Disable WordPress Plugin Update](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-plugin-updates/)
* [Disable WordPress Core Update](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-core-update/)

It's *very* important that you keep your WordPress theme, core and plugins up to date. If you don't, your blog or website could 
be **susceptible to security vulnerabilities** or performance issues.

If you use this plugin, make sure you keep yourself up to date with new releases of your active WordPress version, plugins 
and themes and update them as new versions are released (simply by deactivating this plugin for a short time).
